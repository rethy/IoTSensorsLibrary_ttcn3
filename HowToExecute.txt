How to run the test code in this library?

==> IMPORTANT: DON'T ENABLE DEBUG LOGGING IN THE RUNTIME CONFIG FILE, UNLESS
    YOU *REALLY* HAVE TO DEBUG YOUR CODE!
    All other log events are turned off when needed, and then turned back, but
    DEBUG and ERROR. Logging makes measurements, like distance calculations
    less precise (let check the standard deviation values returned with
    DEBUG enabled and disabled ;-))

Provided, you have installed Titan (otherwise see:
  https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.titan/downloads,
  installation instruction is in the documentation package):
You have to clone the dependencies:
- Titan GPIO test port:
  git clone git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/titan/titan.TestPorts.GPIO.git
- TCCUsefulFunctions:
  git clone https://github.com/eclipse/titan.Libraries.TCCUsefulFunctions.git

In the script ./IoTSensorLibMakefilegen adjust the directory paths according to
your actual path names!

When your HW is collected and ready:
------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir bin && cd bin
../IoTSensorLibMakefilegen
make
ttcn3_start IoTSensorsLibraryTest ../config/IoTSensorLib.cfg
------------------------------------------------------------

IoTSensorLibMakefilegen creates all needed softlinks and Makefile in the bin directory.
If you are using dynamic linking (-l switch is set for makefilegen within
IoTSensorLibMakefilegen) yu shall start test execution by the ../IoTSensorTests_exec
script for the bin directory.

Let the FUN be with you!
